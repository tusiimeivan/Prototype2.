	    <h2> <strong> About Agric-Bridge International</strong></h2>
	    <p>At Agric-Bridge International, we see a world where the farmer who grows your food is not a stranger, but a partner. We are a purpose-driven technology company founded on a simple but powerful belief: the distance between a local farmer and the global market should be a bridge, not a barrier. <br>
        Our platform dismantles the traditional, inefficient supply chains that often leave smallholder farmers underpaid and international buyers disconnected from their source. We replace them with a transparent, direct, and fair digital marketplace. By leveraging technology, we are not just facilitating trade; we are fostering a global community built on mutual respect, fair economics, and a shared commitment to quality and sustainability. AgriBridge Global is more than a platform it's a movement towards a more equitable and connected global food system.</p><br>
    
        <h2><strong> Mission of the Company </strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Our mission is to empower local farmers by providing direct access to the international market, fostering sustainable economic growth, and building a transparent future for global agriculture.</strong></p>
        <p>This mission is the core of everything we do. It means:</p>
